BeatRanker's built-in search engine will allow you to fetch your profile with ease. All you need to do is enter your username.

### Fine-Tune your Recommendations with Modifiers ü´µ

Curious about how you would perform with Ghost Notes, or want to tear up your arms by tackling scores with Super Fast Song enabled? We've got you covered.

BeatRanker implements every Beat Saber modifier allowed on BeatLeader. So, feel free to apply all the modifiers you want, and we'll calculate your new potential scores with the click of a button!

### Sort and Filter to Target Your Goals üèÜ

BeatRanker allows you to seamlessly sort your recommendations by any relevant parameter, such as 'PP gained' if you're looking to earn the most PP, 'Current acc.' if you want to target your lowest accuracy scores, and 'Date set' to renew your oldest scores.

We also feature some helpful filters to narrow down your results, such as only showing those that would yield a boost in weighted PP or maps within a certain star range. If you have an idea for a helpful filter/sorting option, feel free to submit a pull request or DM me on Discord @.furious. and I'll be happy to implement it!

Discover interesting patterns in your skill across maps using our in-depth Plotly scatterplot! This plot features your scoring potential for every ranked map on BeatLeader and updates according to any modifiers you have applied, allowing you to analyze how different modifiers impact your overall gameplay.
